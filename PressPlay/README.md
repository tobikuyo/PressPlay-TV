## Questions (Answer indented below)

1. What was your favorite feature to implement? Why?

`<My favourite feature to implement was the 'Episodes left to catch up' string, because it recognises when a presses the 'Seen' button and it updates the number of episodes left accordingly.>`

2. What was your #1 obstacle or bug that you fixed? How did you fix it?

    `<My number 1 obstacle>`
  
3. Share a chunk of code (or file) you're proud of and explain why.
